Retail crypto traders struggle from a lack of information and tools that institutions and smart money have access to
Unlike in traditional finance, there aren’t commercially available analysis signals to help traders evaluate market movement


User insights	

Retail traders, especially crypto traders, have to handle volatile market conditions and the news that creates them. Often, price action is decoupled from intuition and traders end up gambling on price swings instead of making informed decisions.
The 24/7 nature of crypto markets are inherently primed to increase stress and decision fatigue for retail traders
There’s no good LLM integrations in trading terminals - experienced traders validate their theses and do market research with tools like OpenAI deep research, but this is separate from the tools they use to trade.
In recent years, retail demand for crypto-related fintech products has been higher than institutional demand, except for custody services
There is no existing everything-in-one-place solution for data and information
While retail trading platforms like Robinhood has democratized financial investing, there has not been democratization of investing tools, information, and insights
For a financial markets product with retail volume, there is extractable value from the order flow, allowing for start-state revenue without charging the user for usage
With LLM tooling there is a context problem
Gemini 2.5 pro has a 2 million token context window, allowing synthesis of large amounts of input information without hallucination
Real-time embedding is possible, allowing for RAG, or even graphRAG
If people are willing to pay for wealth management advisors, they should be willing to pay for investment tools
Cognitive Bias Amplification: The crypto market's volatility and 24/7 nature amplifies natural cognitive biases (recency bias, confirmation bias, etc.) in retail traders who lack systematic frameworks to counterbalance these tendencies.
Technical Analysis Overreliance: Many retail traders over-rely on technical analysis without understanding its limitations or contextualizing it with fundamental and sentiment analysis.
Learning Curve Abandonment: The steep learning curve for understanding both trading mechanics and crypto fundamentals leads many retail traders to abandon proper research in favor of simplified heuristics.
Counterparty Risk Blindness: Most retail traders lack tools to evaluate exchange, protocol, or counterparty risks, often discovering these vulnerabilities only after experiencing losses.
Portfolio Correlation Ignorance: Retail traders frequently build portfolios with high correlation between assets, believing they're diversified when they're actually amplifying specific market risks.
Narrative-Driven Trading: Retail traders often trade based on compelling narratives rather than fundamental data, lacking tools to distinguish between substantive developments and marketing hype.
Retail investors love spending a lot of time posting or reading others’ posts on Reddit (e.g. WallStreetBets)
FOMO-Driven Decision Making: The fear of missing out drives many retail traders to make emotional rather than analytical decisions, especially during bull markets or trending assets.
